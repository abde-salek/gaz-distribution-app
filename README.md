# Amana Gaz Distribution App

A cross-platform mobile application built with Flutter and Dart to streamline the delivery and payment process for AMANA GAZ bottle distribution. This app serves as a command center for delivery drivers ('Captains') to manage their clients and daily transactions efficiently.

## Features
*Client Management*: An intuitive UI for tracking clients, their outstanding balances, and handling one-off sales for unregistered customers.

*Performance Dashboard*: Provides Captains with a quick overview of key daily metrics, including total outstanding balance, deliveries, and payments.

*Transaction History*: A comprehensive, color-coded log of all deliveries and payments, giving Captains a clear record of their financial activity.

*Payment Collection Flow*: A focused in-app flow (via a Bottom Sheet) for quick and accurate cash payment collection.

*App Settings*: Includes options for language, data synchronization, and a direct link to report problems.

## UI/UX Design
The application's design is centered around clarity and fast decision-making. A custom visual hierarchy is used to make critical information easily scannable:

Deep Navy (#1B3F77) is used for the app's primary UI elements, representing deliveries, outstanding balances, and money owed.

Teal (#00A3B5) is used as an accent color to highlight positive actions like payments collected and to indicate settled accounts.

## Technologies Used
*Framework*: Flutter

*Language*: Dart

*Version Control*: Git

*Code Editor*: VS Code, Cursor

### Status
The UI/UX design for all core screens (Dashboard, My Clients, Client Details, Settings) is complete. The project is now moving into the Flutter implementation phase.
